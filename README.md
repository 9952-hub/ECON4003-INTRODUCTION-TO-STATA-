ECON4003 INTRODUCTION TO STATA 
Introduction 1.1    Materials and setup ●    Find class materials on Moodle page ●    Download the folder for Stata session and unzip it! 1.2  Organisation ●    Make comments in your Do-file rather than on self-printed hand-outs ●     save on flash drive or email to yourself 1.3    Lab description ●    This is an introduction to Stata ●    Assumes no/very little knowledge of Stata ●    Learning objectives: o  Familiarise yourself with the Stata interface o  Get data in and out of Stata o  Compute statistics and construct graphical displays o  Compute new variables and transformations 1.4    What is Stata? Statistics and Data Analysis ●   A statistical package that includes a wide variety of capabilities o Data management o Statistical and econometric analysis o Graphics etc. ●   Widely used in the fields of economics, finance, political science, sociology, biomedicine and epidemiology ●   Three main versions o Stata/IC (Intercooled): mid-sized datasets o Stata/SE (Special Edition ): large datasets o Stata/MP (Multi-processor ): fastest version (for quad-core, dual-core, and multicore/multiprocessor computers) 1.5    Where you can download Stata? ●   See Stata Installation Guide under Course Resources > Resources for Stata ●   Contact IT Helpdesk for any technical issues 1.6    Stata interface

●     Command window: o Type the instructions we want Stata to execute o Alternatively, type in the Do-file (see next section) ●     Results window o Display the results and output after a command is executed ●     Review window o Keeps arecord of all the commands used/the input history ●    Variables window o Shows all the variables in the dataset ●     Properties window o Indicates the properties of a highlighted variable or save any files ●    Current working directory o Shows the current directory in the file system of your computer from where Stata will read or save any files 1.7    Do-files ●    You can type all the same commands into the Do-file that you would type into the command window ●     BUT...the Do-file allows you to save your commands ●    Saving commands in Do-file allows you to keep a written record of everything you have done to your data o  Allows easy replication o  Allows you to go back andre-run commands, analyses and make modifications 1.8    Stata menu ●    An alternative way to tell Stata what you would like it to do is to use menus and dialogs. ●     Stata’s Data, Graphics, and Statistics menus provide point-and-click access to almost every command in Stata. 1.9    Stata help ●    To get help in Stata type “help” followed by topic or command, e.g., help codebook 1.10  General Stata command syntax ●    Most Stata commands follow the same basic syntax: command varlist, option 1.11  Hand calculator ●     Stata can be used as a calculator using the command: display display 4+5 dis  3^5 dis  10/5 1.12  Commenting ●    Any command in Stata that is preceded by a star character (*) will be regarded as comment, and therefore, not executed *This is a comment 2  Getting data into Stata 2.1  Data file commands ●    First, we set the working directory to the folder you saved your data by selecting: File > Change working directory … ●    Next, we want to open our data file ●    Open/save data sets with "use" and "save" use “nlsw88small.dta”, clear save “nlsw88lab1.dta”, replace The US National Longitudinal Study of Young Women 1998 extract, nlsw88small.dta, contains data of 500 women in their 30s and early 40s to study their labourforce patterns. 2.2 Variable list Variable                                       代 写ECON4003 INTRODUCTION TO STATAProcessing 代做程序编程语言                     Description idcode NLS id age age at current year race race married =1 if married; 0 otherwise never_married =1 if never married; 0 otherwise grade current grade completed, numerical collgrad =1 if college graduate; 0 otherwise south =1 if lives in south; 0 otherwise smsa =1 if lives in SMSA; 0 otherwise c_city =1 if lives in central city; 0 otherwise industry industry category occuptation occupational category union =1 if union worker; 0 otherwise wage hourly wage hours usual hours worked ttl_exp total work experience (years) tenure job tenure (years) 3  Statistics and graphs 3.1  Operators 3.1.1 Relational operators ●    >          // greater than ●    <          // less than ●    >=       // greater than or equal ●    <=       // less than or equal ●    ==       // equal ●    !=        // not equal 3.1.2 Logical operators ●             // and ●     |          // or ●     !
